Q: Consider the following:

A string, , of length  where .
An integer, , where  is a factor of .
We can split  into  substrings where each subtring, , consists of a contiguous block of  characters in . Then, use each  to create string  such that:

The characters in  are a subsequence of the characters in .
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in  occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index  in  occurs at a previous index  in , then do not include the character in string .
Given  and , print  lines where each line  denotes string .
