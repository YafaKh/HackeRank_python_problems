'''
A stack is a data structure that stores items in an Last-In/First-Out manner. This is frequently referred to as LIFO. This is in contrast to a queue, which stores items in a First-In/First-Out (FIFO) manner. There are a couple of options when youâ€™re implementing a Python stack.

For example we can use: list or collections.deque

Your are requested to try both of them and submit the collections (2nd) solution
'''

stack1 = deque()
stack1.append(10)
stack1.append(50)
stack1.pop()

print("Stack has only", stack1[-1])
